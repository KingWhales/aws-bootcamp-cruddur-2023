# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

# HONEYCOMB
I got to know about honeycomb as a distributed tracing service and I got to implement it with the help of Andrew and Jessica. Honeycomb is used for logging and created data. I created an account with Honeycomb as I didn't have an account, and created an environment and used that environment's API Key to connect my Cruddur application data with Honeycomb, I followed the guidance as demonstrated in the youtube video and I was able to create an environment and connect it with Honeycomb for data logging and tracing
