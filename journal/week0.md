# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
Setting up Billing alarm
I had to login into my root account to grant my User account access to the  billing console

I logged in from another browser which is Firefox to save  me the stress of logging out of my User account, then  I granted my user account permission to access billing console

I went ahead to enable billing alert first before I can set up billing alarm, I clicked on billing preference and put in the email address I want to receive alert with
